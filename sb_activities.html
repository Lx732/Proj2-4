      <h3>Summer (Image of favorite toys)</h3>
         <p>If you want a toy to disappear quickly and save a local small animal. Gift a stuffed animal that looks as real as possible. She is a huntress.
Her favorite toy is hot pink with a green squeaker ball built inside. No one is allowed to squeak it. She will cry. I think she thinks we will hurt it? She loves to cuddle with it and takes it with her everywhere in the house and the backyard. As a precaution she is not allowed to take it to the playdates, dog parks or any other outing.
Her second favorite toy is a black and blue Nerf duck. She uses it as a pillow sometimes.
